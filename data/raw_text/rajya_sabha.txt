River Water Quality Results.  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) carries out water quality monitoring of river Ganga.   As per CPCB criteria for ensuring river water quality to bathing standards BOD value has been prescribed below 3 mg/l.  As per the report, the Polluted River Stretches (PRSs) on river Ganga based on the assessment carried out in 2022 (2019 & 2021 data), are as under: a. Uttarakhand does not fall under polluted stretch (BOD <3mg/l); b. In Uttar Pradesh, Farrukhabad to Allahabad &Mirzapur to Ghazipur in - Priority Class V (BOD 3-6 mg/l); c. In Bihar, along Buxar, Patna, Fatwah and Bhagalpur - Priority Class IV (BOD 6-10 mg/l); d. Jharkhand does not fall under polluted stretch (BOD <3mg/l); e.
