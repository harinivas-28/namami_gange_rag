 Implementation Status and Key Decisions


   The Project is making significant progress in key areas, including procurement and implementation of wastewater investments,
   increased project disbursements, progress with obtaining government clearances for the IBRD Guarantee, and improved
   implementation of environmental, social, health, and safety measures. In addition, NMCG has adopted institutional development
   recommendations for river basin management, launched an online monitoring platform, planned to revamp the Ganga Knowledge
   Center, and completed four national level television commercials to raise awareness about the Namami Gange Programme.

                                        The indicator is partially met..



 Overall Comments PDO

  An online system for continuous monitoring of water quality with public access is functional. The indicator is partially met given that flow data is
  not yet integrated into the NMCG online portal. Public access to flow data is considered restricted as per the 2018 hydro-meteorological
  dissemination policy. Data can be shared with government entities, but sharing flow data with the public is restricted. During the MTR mission,
  there was a proposal to adjust the indicator to: key stakeholders have access to an online system for continuous monitoring of water quality
  and flow in the Ganga and selected tributaries.

  During the mission, NMCG also proposed modifying the institutional framework indicator to Implementing the recommendations of the study on
  the institutional framework for the Ganga River.

  The mission and NMCG agreed to change the target of PDO2 from 12 to 20 STPs to reflect current and programmed investments better.

  Overall, intermediate indicators will achieve the targets, but a few indicator modifications are proposed. The MTR mission discussed
  adjustments to intermediate indicators and targets to improve clarity and ensure a realistic link between the Project’s investments and
  outcomes.

  The e-flow and the ULB indicators are proposed as follows:

  (i) Detailed assessment of environmental flow for selected impacted river reaches completed and disseminated; target: 4 environmental flow
  studies.

  (ii) Number of ULBs with Urban River Management Plans (URMPs) and financing roadmap. Change the target to 18 ULBs.

  NMCG also proposed modifying the targets from the network laid and household connections delivered to 600 km and 162,000 households,
  respectively.

  Water quality monitoring stations experienced a decline. Still, these are expected to increase with the procurement of 110 real-time water
  quality monitoring stations.
