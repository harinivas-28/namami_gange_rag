# Faiss index temporary files (if any are generated)
# Note: Ensure you are NOT ignoring the actual faiss_index directory itself,
# just potential temp files or specific sub-files if they are generated during local dev.
# The `vector_store/faiss_index/` directory itself should be committed to Git if it's
# part of your deployable artifact.
# If your FAISS index is very large and you plan to download it at deploy time
# rather than committing it, you might add vector_store/faiss_index/, but generally
# for RAG, the index is part of the code that gets deployed.
# For this structure, we assume vector_store/faiss_index/ IS committed.
